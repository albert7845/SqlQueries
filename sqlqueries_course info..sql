there should be a foreign key violation becauseÂ 
'section' and 'takes' also this tuple, which the foreign key of 
'takes' reference to 'section' and 'section' reference to the 'course'. 
so we need to delete the tuple in the order of 'takes','section' and 'course'.
However, in this case, the foreign key of these 3 tables 
above have 'on delete cascade' constraints while creating, which we could 
directly delete "CS-001" from 'course' table without error.*/
